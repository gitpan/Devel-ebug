     - create valid XML no matter what the variables or code contains
       (thanks to Mark Fowler)
     - correct the =head1 NAME of ebug and ebug_http (spotted by Smylers)
     - stack_trace_human is now more robust
     - Test::Expect doesn't work under Windows, so don't require or
       use it in Windows environments - this means we now require
       Module::Build (spotted by Johan Lindstrom)
     - make codelines() remove DOS as well as UNIX newlines (spotted
       by Johan Lindstrom)

     - added undo method which undos the last action
     - in ebug_http, using the back button in the browser actually
       steps backwards in the program (suggested by autrijus)
     - in ebug_http, use monikers for blessed objects and make the
       stack trace use a smaller font
     - in ebug, restart the program instead of exiting at the end of
       the program (suggested by obra)
     - in ebug_http, restart the program instead of stopping the
       webserver at the end of the program
     - added stack_trace_human method for a human-readable stack trace
     - pointed out ebug and ebug_http in the docs

     - fix a problem where we were displaying the wrong codelines in

     - now use the environment instead of the command line to pass the

0.30 Thu Mar 31 00:13:13 CST 2005
     - autrijus noticed that 0.29 shipped with a broken ebug. to keep
       me from embarassing myself in future, there is now an ebug.t
       which uses the newly-released Test::Expect
     - codelines() now returns an array
     - codelines() now returns the whole file if no line numbers are
       passed

       the currently executing program
