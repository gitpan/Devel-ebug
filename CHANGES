     - autrijus noticed that 0.29 shipped with a broken ebug. to keep
       me from embarassing myself in future, there is now an ebug.t
       which uses the newly-released Test::Expect
     - codelines() now returns an array
     - codelines() now returns the whole file if no line numbers are
       passed
     - codelines() can now return the source code of files other than
       the currently executing program
     - added some security to the TCP connection (port, secret)
     - added a new "y" to ebug, which YAML::Dump's variables
     - minor code cleanups
